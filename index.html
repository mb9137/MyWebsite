<h1>THE GREAT PLAGUE</h1>
  <p>
  The great plague happened in the years 1665 and 1666, it may have only lasted a year but it killed around 25 million people in the whole of England.
    The plague started with small fleas who carried the plague as they jumped on rats then the rats spread the plauge onto humans causing the deadly plague. The cause of
    the end of the great plague was actually the fire of London killing of the rats with the plague.
